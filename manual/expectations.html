      <h1>Expectations</h1>
      <div class="lead">
<p>We intend to foster a <strong>healthy and collegial lab atmosphere</strong>, with
opportunities for spontaneous discussions, creativity, close collaboration, and
career progression.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="expectations-of-lab-members">Expectations of lab members</h2>
<p>A large part of fostering a healthy work environment is taking care of our
mental well-being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lab members are <strong>not expected to sacrifice personal or leisure time</strong> in
service of projects.</li>
<li>Working long hours without interruption can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and
overall <strong>impedes</strong> the type of atmosphere we are trying to develop.</li>
<li>Lab members are encouraged to <strong>take anual breaks and vacation</strong> time. This
is particularly important after periods of high stress (exams, thesis
defense, qualifying exams, workshops, etc). Please <strong>let Leo know</strong> when you
will be away.</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
<p><strong>Mental health:</strong>
Time as a graduate student and as a postdoc is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/anxiety-depression-mental-health-graduate-school/576769/">known to cause undue
stress</a>,
resulting in consequences ranging from mild to extremely severe.
Please reach out and use the resources in
<a href="health.html">Health and well-being</a> if you ever need help.</p>
</div>
<p>We strive to be a part of the intellectual community at our host universities.
As such, lab members should endeavor to be <strong>good university “citizens”</strong>,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participating in department seminars</strong>, meetings, and other academic
activities.</li>
<li>Collaborating with individuals from <strong>other groups/departments</strong> around
campus.</li>
<li>Fostering new collaborations, both internally and externally.</li>
</ul>
<p>As lab members, Leo expects you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the lab <a href="coc.html">Code of conduct</a> and general
<a href="open-science.html">Open science</a> guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Be proactive</strong> in communicating your needs and desires (guidance,
equipment, personal time, career plans, chance of project/mentorship, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Be present</strong> and working regularly during term time. Please let Leo know if
you are busy with other commitments (personal or academic) and won’t be
working on your project for a time.</li>
<li>Keep on top of <strong>your own deadlines</strong> (assignments, reports, conferences,
etc). Leo will remind you if he can but the responsibility for keeping to
your deadlines is yours.
Remember to give Leo <strong>at least 1 week</strong> (but preferably more) to give
feedback on any piece of work.</li>
<li><strong>Care</strong> for the physical environment of the lab, including lab computers,
books, coffee kit, etc.</li>
<li>Maintain a healthy, constructive, and <strong>positive atmosphere</strong> in the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Be curious</strong> and self-motivated about your project and your studies.
Remember that <strong>the project is yours</strong> and you must read widely and think
deeply about it.</li>
<li><strong>Take the initiative in writing</strong> your papers, dissertations, and thesis.
Leo will not write these for you but will help you get started and teach you
how to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expectations above are the same for all lab members.
Some expectations also vary according to your level of study.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate students</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritize your studies</strong>. While work on your project is important, it
should never come at the expense of your studies.
Your grades can matter for entry into graduate programmes and obtaining
scholarships in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Be present</strong> in the lab at least once a week. This will help you stay
connected, even during busy times. More experienced lab members can also help
you study!</li>
</ul>
<h3>MSc students</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicate to learning</strong> everything you can about your project. It’s common
to start an MSc in something you don’t quite master yet but you should be an
expert by the end of your degree.</li>
<li><strong>Try things for yourself</strong> before coming to Leo for help. Thinking deeply
about a problem is a requirement for true understanding. You should not
deny yourself the opportunity to grow by asking for help immediately when you
encounter a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Be mindful of your time</strong>. The 2 years of your degree will pass very
quickly and it’s important not to lose track of your project and deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PhD students</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be independent</strong> in coming up with your research topics and ideas for what
to do next. Many of these will be tied to the lab’s ongoing projects but this
is the time to start thinking for yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Help junior members</strong> in their research and studies.</li>
<li><strong>Study broadly</strong>, beyond your research topic. A PhD is a wonderful time to
explore different topics, research fields, career pathways, and ideas. Good
ways to do this are watching seminars (both in and out of the department),
talking to your fellow PhD students, reading papers/blogs from other fields,
and attending talks/posters at large conferences.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Postdocs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead your project</strong> and be on top of any logistics and organization that is
required to undertake it. Postdocs are independent researchers and taking on
responsibilities like this are very beneficial for getting an academic
position later on.</li>
<li><strong>Mentor</strong> junior lab members and complement the support that Leo provides.</li>
<li><strong>Help in teaching and outreach</strong> efforts of the lab. This does not mean
teaching a full course or replacing Leo in any capacity. It means providing
a lecture or two about your expertise in a course, leading a short workshop,
helping Leo organize outreach, etc. All of these are very good things to have
on a CV when applying for an academic job.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-you-can-expect-from-leo">What you can expect from Leo</h2>
<p>Mentoring is a two-way relationship.
These are things that you expect from Leo:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lead</strong> and set directions for the group’s research efforts.</li>
<li>Prioritize and <strong>support your career</strong> progression and well-being, providing
the required training and resources for your particular needs.</li>
<li>Be willing to <strong>listen to criticism</strong> and suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust the style of mentorship</strong> to what works best for you (please let me
know if something isn’t working well).</li>
<li><strong>Respond to your messages</strong> and requests within a reasonable time, which is
around 1 day to 1 week depending on urgency and Leo’s schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Respect your personal time</strong> and not ask for things to be done during
evenings, weekends, holidays, and vacation time. You may get a message at
these times due to Leo’s own working hours but you have no obligation to
respond.</li>
<li><strong>Seek funding</strong> to support lab activities, purchase equipment, scholarships,
and conference attendance.</li>
</ul>
