    <h1>A 2025 retrospective of the CompGeoLab</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Published on 2025/12/19 by Leonardo Uieda.
    </p>
    <p>2025 is drawing to a close and I’d like to end it with a brief retrospective of
all that happened in the Lab this past year.
Overall, it was a great and productive year, with some ups and downs, busy
moments, good reviews, bad reviews, but altogether good time with great people.
So here’s a (probably not comprehensive) list of all we did:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../team#Souza-junior">Gelson</a> came back to São Paulo after spending a year
at Harvard University making tons of measurements on our collaborator
<a href="https://eps.harvard.edu/people/roger-fu/">Roger Fu</a>’s Quantum Diamond
Microscope. All of his hard work resulted in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/X5N42F">preprint about a huge
improvement to his inversion method</a>,
a <a href="https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.176071652.24509178/v1">preprint about non-dipolar effects in
microscopy</a> (in
collaboration with <a href="https://ualissonbellon.wixsite.com/magnetic-records">Ualisson Bellon</a> from Edinburgh), and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15132658">tons of datasets</a> for us to
analyse! There will actually be two more results coming out of this 1-year
stay at Harvard which we hope to share with everyone in 2026.</li>
<li><a href="../team#indiauppal">India</a> had her first first-author <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaf359">paper
published</a>, which contains some really
unexpected results from applying a dual-layer setup to equivalent sources
interpolation of magnetic data. This will be the basis for a lot of the work
the Lab will be doing in the coming years!</li>
<li>I had the chance to finally work on a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaf114">paper I started in
2012</a> which introduces <em>Euler
Inversion</em>, a brand new formulation of the Euler deconvolution problem which
is much more stable and robust.</li>
<li><a href="../team#chagas-gabriel">Gabriel</a> completed his undergraduate research
project on 3D inversion of gravity data and is starting a new one revisiting
a relationship between the Bouguer gravity disturbance and topography.</li>
<li>Undergraduate researchers Felipe Nascimento Hong, Paulo Eduardo Crystal, and
Sofia Vieira dos Santos have joined the lab and will be working on all sorts
of problems related to potential fields in the coming year. They bring a lot
of new life into the Lab and I’m really excited to share what they
accomplish in 2026!</li>
<li><a href="../team#arthursmacedo">Arthur</a> and <a href="../team#YagoMCastro">Yago</a> presented
their MSc projects at the <a href="https://latinmag.geofisica.unam.mx/index.html">8th LATINMAG Meeting</a> in Morelia, Mexico.</li>
<li><a href="../team#ErosKerouak">Eros</a>, Gabriel, Arthur, and Yago presented their work
at the <a href="https://www.rio25.sbgf.org.br/">Rio’25 Conference</a> of the SBGf. All
of them received a ton of praise for their work and I was so proud of all of
them!</li>
<li>Me, Yago, and Arthur taught the workshop <a href="https://github.com/compgeolab/kit">“Kit de sobrevivência digital para
cientistas”</a> at the <a href="iag-summer-school-2025.html">IAG Geophysics
Summer School</a> which was really well received
by the participants and which we’ll be teaching again in 2026.</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, it was a great year and I couldn’t have asked for a better group of
people with which to spend it.
I’m so proud of all that they have achieved in 2025 and I’m really looking
forward to 2026!</p>
